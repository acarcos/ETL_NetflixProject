# ETL_NetflixProject

* From Data Analytics Boot Camp at Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Monterrey


## Guidelines

### Finding Data

We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:

* [data.world](https://data.world/)

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)


## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
